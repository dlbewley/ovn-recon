{"id":"ovn-recon-n5c","title":"Rethink Gravity Algorithm for Edge Crossing Minimization","description":"Redesign the gravity calculation algorithm to minimize edge crossings in the graph visualization.\n\nCurrent Problem:\n- Current gravity is based on connection count, which doesn't consider visual layout\n- Nodes in connected paths (e.g., ens192 -\u003e br-ex -\u003e physnet -\u003e machinenet CUDN -\u003e machinenet NAD) should be aligned vertically at the top of their respective columns\n- This will prevent edges from crossing other edges\n\nProposed Solution:\n1. Identify connected paths/chains through the graph (especially primary/long paths)\n2. Assign lower gravity (higher priority) to nodes that are part of longer connected paths\n3. Use a path-aware algorithm that considers:\n   - Path length (longer paths get priority)\n   - Position in path (earlier nodes in path get priority)\n   - Or use a topological sort that considers graph structure\n\nImplementation approach:\n- Build a graph representation of all connections\n- Identify primary paths (longest paths, or paths with most connections)\n- Calculate path-based gravity: nodes in longer paths get lower gravity\n- Fallback to connection-count gravity for nodes not in identified paths\n- Ensure nodes in the same path align vertically (same Y position across columns)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-05T20:22:40.711942-08:00","created_by":"dale","updated_at":"2026-01-05T20:22:40.711942-08:00"}
