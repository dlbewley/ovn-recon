{"id":"ovn-recon-9bs","title":"Improve Drawer UX: Overlay drawer and enable diagram pan/zoom","description":"When viewing the details of a graph node, the Drawer component slides out from the right and causes the diagram visualization to shrink. \n\n**Current Behavior:**\n- The Drawer uses `isInline` prop which causes the content area to resize when the drawer expands\n- The SVG diagram shrinks to accommodate the drawer panel\n- Users cannot pan or zoom the diagram\n- Tab selection resets to 'summary' when clicking between different nodes\n\n**Desired Behavior:**\n1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: The drawer should slide over the diagram without resizing it (overlay mode) - Removed `isInline` prop, drawer now overlays content\n2. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Persist the selected tab when clicking a new graph node - If viewing YAML tab of one node and clicking another node, drawer should default to YAML tab (preserves tab selection when switching nodes)\n3. Enable user interaction for resizing and moving/panning the diagram\n4. Consider adding zoom functionality for better navigation of large diagrams\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- Current implementation in `src/components/NodeVisualization.tsx` uses `Drawer` component (line 1105)\n- The SVG is rendered inside `DrawerContentBody` (line 1107)\n- Changed drawer behavior from inline to overlay by removing `isInline` prop\n- Added `position: relative` to CardBody for proper overlay positioning\n- Modified `handleNodeClick` to preserve tab selection when switching between nodes (only resets to 'summary' when drawer first opens)\n- May need to add SVG pan/zoom library (e.g., react-zoom-pan-pinch or similar) for item 3","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-07T14:22:08.35481-08:00","created_by":"dale","updated_at":"2026-01-07T14:32:26.255543-08:00","comments":[{"id":1,"issue_id":"ovn-recon-9bs","author":"dale","text":"✅ Item 1 COMPLETED: Drawer now slides over diagram without resizing it.

Header shows 'Node Network State' with no indication that this is the OVN Recon plugin\n   - Users may not realize they're in a plugin context\n   - Missing plugin branding/identity\n\n2. View toggles take up too much vertical space within the diagram\n   - Toggles (e.g., 'Show hidden columns', 'Show Net Attach Defs') consume valuable diagram space\n   - Reduces available area for the network visualization\n   - Should be more compact or repositioned\n\n3. Breadcrumb view implies navigation via NodeNetworkState\n   - Current breadcrumb suggests users arrived from NodeNetworkState resource\n   - Should instead be a simple link to NodeNetworkState (if needed)\n   - Or remove breadcrumb entirely if not necessary for navigation\n\nProposed Solutions:\n1. Update header to clearly indicate OVN Recon plugin\n   - Add plugin name/branding to header\n   - Consider: 'OVN Recon - Network Topology' or similar\n   - Ensure it's clear this is a plugin view\n\n2. Optimize toggle placement and design\n   - Move toggles to a more compact location (e.g., top toolbar, side panel, or inline with header)\n   - Consider horizontal layout instead of vertical\n   - Use icon buttons or compact toggle switches\n   - Reduce vertical space consumption\n\n3. Redesign breadcrumb/navigation\n   - Remove breadcrumb if not needed for navigation\n   - Or replace with a simple link to NodeNetworkState resource\n   - Ensure navigation doesn't imply a specific entry point\n\nImplementation considerations:\n- Review current header implementation in NodeNetworkStateDetails component\n- Assess toggle component placement and styling\n- Evaluate breadcrumb necessity and redesign options\n- Consider overall plugin branding and user experience\n- Ensure changes maintain accessibility and usability","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-06T11:25:12.322879-08:00","created_by":"dale","updated_at":"2026-01-06T11:25:12.322879-08:00"}
