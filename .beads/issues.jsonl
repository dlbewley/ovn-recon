View toggles take up too much vertical space within the diagram\n   - Toggles (e.g., 'Show hidden columns', 'Show Net Attach Defs') consume valuable diagram space\n   - Reduces available area for the network visualization\n   - Should be more compact or repositioned\n\n3. Breadcrumb view implies navigation via NodeNetworkState\n   - Current breadcrumb suggests users arrived from NodeNetworkState resource\n   - Should instead be a simple link to NodeNetworkState (if needed)\n   - Or remove breadcrumb entirely if not necessary for navigation\n\n4. No way to switch between different hosts/nodes\n   - Currently only shows one NodeNetworkState at a time\n   - Users must navigate back to list to select a different host\n   - Should be able to switch hosts directly from the visualization view\n\n**Proposed Solutions:**\n1. Update header to clearly indicate OVN Recon plugin\n   - Add plugin name/branding to header\n   - Consider: 'OVN Recon - Network Topology' or similar\n   - Ensure it's clear this is a plugin view\n   - Consider adding operator logo to left of header.\n\n2.
